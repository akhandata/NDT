### Pest and Disease Management
1. Apply calcium at the base of the trunk for control of termite atattack
2. Apply calcium powder on upper soil
3. Avoid the cutting of green leaves. If needed, they should be cut about 120 cm away from the stem in order to prevent successful inward movement of the grubs through the cut end*
4. ***Entomofungal pathogen Hirsutella thompsonii and Verticillium lecanii*** are reported to be promising in managing the mites. Both the pathogens are mass multiplied by a commercial firm and sold in the market.
5. Apply mixture of either neem ***seed powder + sand (1:2) @150 g per palm or neem seed kernel powder + sand (1:2) @150 g*** per palm in the base of the 3 inner most leaves in the crown.

- Trap Method:
- Coconut Log Traps:

Setting up of attractant traps (mud pots) containing ***sugarcane molasses 2½ kg or toddy 2½ litres (or pineapple or sugarcane activated with yeast or molasses) + acetic acid 5 ml + yeast 5 g + longitudinally split tender coconut stem/logs of green petiole of leaves of 30 numbers*** in one acre to trap adult red palm weevils in large numbers. Incorporate any of the insecticide to each trap to kill the weevils trapped.

### Pheromone Trap @ one trap per ha<br/><br/>
**Step 1:** *Specialized buckets with 3 of 4 holes are made, the bucket is wound with coconut fibre/ jute sack, so that the pests can enter.*  
**Step 2:** *The lure (Ferrolure +) is suspended inside the bucket and one lit of water is added along with 100g pineapple/ sugarcane, 2g yeast and 2g Carbaryl in the bucket.*  
**Step 3:** *The bait buckets are placed at sites in the farm, where infestation is seen most.*  
**Step 4:** *After a week the water is checked for the catch & re filled to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.*
